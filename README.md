# Multisig wallet

### What will I be trying to build: 

For now, this is how I interpret the challenge:

1. Write a multisig contract with addSigner and removeSigner functions.
2. Get the front-end working with it and understand how the project works with off-chain and on-chain transactions / steps. Hint: use of recover and understanding how hexstrings and hashes work.
3. Pull components from scaffold-eth example repo that Chris has updated (thanks!). The front-end components will work nicely with your code.
4. Once you get the base of the challenge done, see if I can call a function from an external contract such as uniswap swap ETH for DAI, and have your multisig owners vote on it.

The first 3 steps... tbh you can probably just use the implementation code (smart contracts) and front-end that Chris has created. You'll have to figure out how to bring in a scanning component from punkwallet branch from scaffold-eth repo (not scaffold-eth examples repo).
